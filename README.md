DLSToDoList
===========

iOS To Do List application using Core Data for storage and customized UI

This application provides expected to do list functionality. Persistent data storage with a Core Data model,
ability to add and remove objects from the database and tableview, ability to mark items as completed with
a cell accessory, and also includes automatic scrolling to the bottom of the table when a new item is added
to the list which would take it beyond the view of the display.

The application also uses a slightly modified version of UIKit objects as I learned how to modify their
attributes in code.
